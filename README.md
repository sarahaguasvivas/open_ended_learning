### Open Ended Learning

Here, we try to simulate the state-of-the-art models for human memory storage. We start from the model described in Baddeley (2012) on the Working Memory, which is a continuation of the work shown in the book Working Memory, Thought and Action.

We have a collection of `fluid` and `crystalized` systems in the following structure:

- Central Executive 
     - Visuo-spatial sketch-pad
     - Episodic Buffer
     - Phonological Loop

In the crystallized systems we have:

- Visual semantics
- episodic LTM
- Language
